throughout most of this series we've

been using the swagger ui to debug and

test our web apis

but don't get mad at me if i tell you

that there's another option as well

we can use the http ripple to explore

our web apis and we can do it all via

the command line

why don't we take a look and see how it

works the way that we work with the http

rebel is by invoking it on the command

line

so i'll type in http rebel but notice

that i don't have it installed

so we need to issue this command dotnet

tool installed

and the name of the package which is

microsoft.net dash

http reference

now that it's installed i should be able

to type http reply-h

and i should be able to see all of the

available options that there so notice

that i could connect to a particular api

i can issue various http commands and i

even have the option to navigate through

an api

so let's clear the screen and see how we

can connect it to our web api

our base url is localhost 5001 so let's

do http reply

and i'll give it the base address

and now we should be connected to our

api if i wanted to see what endpoints

are available i can use the ls command

and since our recipe's endpoints are

prefixed with the slash api

i need to navigate down that path let's

do slash api

now let's navigate down one more level

and go into that recipes path

now inside here i can just type get and

that will issue a get request against

the slash api

recipes endpoint

whoa and there you see it's returned to

us a collection of recipes

what if we wanted to just get one recipe

let's grab

the id from one of these recipes i'll

type in ls

and notice that i have the option to

invoke an endpoint with that id token

so if i type get i'm passing that id

when i hit enter it should just return

that single recipe

the http reply allows me to navigate

through my api

just like i'm navigating through folders

on my desktop and this is all powered by

that open api specification that we've

been talking about throughout the series

now let's say you actually wanted to use

a ui i can type ui

enter and this will actually open a

browser tab with the swagger ui so you

have the option to go between both if

you wanted to

using the replica allows you to do more

than just issue get requests

you can use put post patch delete and

tons of the other ones

i can set the http headers and i can

even set the body that gets sent over in

the request

if you're a person that prefers working

in the command line i think this is a

great option for you to check out

you
