>> ASP.NET Core defines a
lot of interesting types and

properties that we could use to
inspect the incoming request.

We can even define the types of

information we want to
pull out of the request

and have it provided to our
action methods as parameters.

This process is usually
referred to as binding.

Now when it comes to binding,

there's a lot of different parts from

that request that we can
get information from.

For instance, we might want to
get information from the body,

or from an HTTP header,
or even the query string.

We usually refer to these
as binding sources.

The way that we specify a binding
source inside of our code,

is [inaudible] we can
use binding attributes.

So we can use a from
attribute and say

I want to get information
from the header,

or from the body,

or I want to get it
from the query string.

Now, let's take a look at a
practical example and see how we

can use these binding parameters
inside of Visual Studio.

Let's take another look
at our GET operation

inside of our recipes controller.

Now a common ask whenever
requesting resources is to be able

to limit the number of resources
that get returned from our API.

One way we could do this is by
specifying a count parameter.

Now, where exactly is this
information is going to come from?

Like we mentioned before,

we can use those binding attributes.

Here, I'm specifying from query.

That means that ASP.NET Core is

going to pull that
from the query string.

The next thing that
I want to do is use

that parameter inside
of my action method.

Here you can see I'm
using a take method from

link to return the right
number of recipes.

Let's go ahead and run
this and see what happens.

Now that my Swagger UI is up,

let's inspect that GET operation.

Notice that I have that count
parameter available for me to use.

I can give it a value,
and let's execute it.

One, so that's the right number,

and then two. There you go.

We know that the right value
is being pulled out of

the query string and supply
to our action method.

Now this is not the end of binding
and there's way more sources

that we could use to supply
information to our Web API.

But we're going to
take a look at some of

those a little further
on into series.
