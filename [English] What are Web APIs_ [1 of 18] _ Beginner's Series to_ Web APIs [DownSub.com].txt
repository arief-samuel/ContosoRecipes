>> Hi, everyone.
Thank you so much for

joining us on this
introductory series

on building web APIs
with ASP.NET Core.

My name is Cecil Phillip
and over the course

of the next few videos,

our goal is to be able to give you

the information that you need to be

successful when you want to
build web APIs using .NET.

Now, if you're unfamiliar with .NET,

maybe this is the first time that

you're really starting
to build stuff with it,

I recommend that you first
head over to the .NET website.

Here on the site, you can
get access to a lot of

great introductory
level video concept

that covers topics such as C#,

ASP.NET Core and even .NET Core.

I think these three videos
in particular will give you

the prerequisites that you need
to be successful in this series.

Before we really dive into

the conversation about
building web APIs,

I think it's important that
we understand what are they?

What are web APIs?

To do that, let's separate
that term into two parts.

We'll have the Web part,

and we'll also have the API part.

Now when we think about web,

we usually talk about ways that
we can exchange information with

each other over things like
HTTP or even a web browser.

When we think about APIs now, well,

API stands for Application
Programming Interface.

Essentially, those are collections of

operations that you can
invoke on a machine,

either locally or remotely.

Now, putting those two terms back
together and we get web APIs.

Web APIs are operations
that I can invoke over

HTTP to be able to leverage

the functionality that
those operations provide.

I can use that inside
of my applications

to really enhance the experience
that I'm trying to create.

Now, it turns out regardless of
the app that you're building,

you can make use of a web API also.

Whether you're building a mobile
app or a desktop app or a game,

you can do things like leaderboard
tracking or managing contacts,

looking up business information
or recipe information.

It also turns out that web
apps can use web APIs,

and web APIs could use web APIs too,

which I think has a really cool

dynamic to how we could put
these applications there.

Now that we've seen some examples
of apps that could use web APIs,

why don't we talk about examples
of web APIs themselves?

Within the Microsoft ecosystem,

I think there's a few interesting
operations we can look at.

Microsoft Graph, for instance,

is a collection of APIs that gives us

information back out
of our M365 account.

If you use Azure
DevOps for your CICD,

you can get information about

your DevOps pipeline using
the Azure DevOps API.

Also, if you're interested
in doing machine learning

and adding that
functionality to your app,

you can use something like
the Cognitive Services.

If you're building games, again,

PlayFab is an interesting set of

APIs that can do things
like leaderboard tracking,

scoring, and player management.

Now, if some of the stuff sounds
really interesting to you,

and hopefully it does, stay tuned
for the rest of the course,

where we'll really dive into

the business of building web
APIs using ASP.NET Core.

In the next video, we're
going to talk about HTTP,

which I think really forms

the cornerstone of how we
can build our web APIs.
